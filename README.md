# Project Objectives

## 1. DFA Conversion
- **Manual State Diagram Coding:** Implement the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) by hand-coding the state diagram.
- **Automated DFA Compilation:** Develop a tool or script to automate the creation and compilation of the DFA state diagram.

## 2. Simulator
- **Input Handling:** Process input patterns (strings) using the DFA.
  - **Automaton Processing:** Use the DFA to simulate the processing of the input.
  - **Trace Generation:** Generate and display a trace of symbols, including up to approximately 1000 states, before reaching the final state.

## 3. Locality Analysis
- **Static Locality:** Analyze the static locality of the DFA.
- **Dynamic Locality:** Examine the dynamic locality of the DFA.
